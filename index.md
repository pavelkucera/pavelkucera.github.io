I am first and foremost a curious learner.

Currently, I am dipping my toes into management and formal leadership by being a Software Engineering Manager at [TwentyThree](https://twentythree.com).
It has been a journey which has challenged me a bunch on many aspects of how I work, and it has been very rewarding too---seeing people grow, partially thanks to my feedback, is meaningful to me.

My background is in computer science and software engineering, which I am very enthusiastic about.
My all time favourite topics are:

- Functional programming and types (I just *love* Haskell)
- Security
- Automation
