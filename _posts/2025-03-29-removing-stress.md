I recently removed a source of low-key but long-term stress. And oh wow!
Everything is so much better. I feel better, I sleep better, I have more energy.

I wish I had removed the stress sooner. I knew it was there, and I kept finding
reasons for why it wasn't that bad. I kept convincing myself that it's the
good kind of stress, the kind that motivates you, pushes you forward and teaches
you. Turns out, it definitely wasn't. I am definitely not the first person to
experience this. And I am definitely not the last person to experience this.
It's likely not even the last time _I_ am experiencing this myself. 

This is a reminder, for myself and anyone reading. Even when it seems manageable
or low-key, removing long-term stress is really worth it. The relief of change
outperforms the discomfort of change.
