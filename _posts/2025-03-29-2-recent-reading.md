A list of what I've read recently that I found useful:

## [The Best Product Engineering Org in the World](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2025/the-best-product-engineering-org-in-the-world)  
I love the approach of asking "If _we_ had the best product engineering
organization in the world, what would it look like?" and finding answers that
fit a specific organization.

## [Cognitive load is what matters](https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive)  
This resonates with how I think about making software these days: in three
years, when another developer is maintaining this code, will it be easy for
them?

## [Moving IO to the edges of your app: Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1vES9AgfC4)  
A very practical talk about making business logic pure. I love that Scott had
examples including using a database---something that I've struggled
wrapping my head around with functional programming.

## [Air purifiers are a simple answer to allergies](https://world.hey.com/dhh/air-purifiers-are-a-simple-answer-to-allergies-3ea70b03)  
Since my parents got an air purifier, the whole family is suffering less from
allergies. And I am now buying an air purifier.
