The talk took place on 21. 11. 2019 at [CopenhagenJS](https://copenhagenjs.dk/archive/2019-11-21-november-meetup/). Huge thanks to the organizers for making the event happen!

In the talk I explore how to use TypeScript's [mapped](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#mapped-types) and [conditional](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#mapped-types) types to enforce validations.
Main aim is to show how to use these features of TypeScript, not necessarily how to define validations in the most convenient way.
